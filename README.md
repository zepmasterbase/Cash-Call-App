📌 Overview

CashCall is a lightweight, mobile-friendly web application that allows users to request money using only a phone number.
Payers receive a secure payment link — they do not need to create an account or install an app.

Built for Africa first, but functional for anyone globally. Whether you're in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Zambia, or anywhere across the continent, CashCall provides an easy way to request payments from friends, family, customers, and clients around the world.

🌍 African-First but Global-Ready

CashCall’s mission is to modernize how Africans send and receive money:

Works globally

Supports African currencies

Integrates with African PSPs like:

Paystack (Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa)

Flutterwave (20+ African countries)

Ozow (South Africa Instant EFT)

PayFast / Peach Payments (South Africa)

M-Pesa (Kenya, Tanzania)



You can request money from anyone in the world, but CashCall’s flows are optimised for African users.
